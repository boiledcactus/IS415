Why are we learning about it, and how is it relevant to a business or a governmental/academic institution?\r\nA quick Google search brings up thousands upon thousands of answers, articles, and research papers: I recommend [Deloitteâ€™s 3-Minute Guide] (https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Deloitte-Analytics/dttl-analytics-us-ba-geospatial3minguide.pdf) on why geospatial analytics matters and the value it brings to a business its data.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn todayâ€™s Hands-On Exercise, weâ€™ll be doing an introduction to geospatial analytics in R: - importing the data and (if necessary) converting it into an accessible format - carrying out geoprocessing tasks with sf - carrying out data wrangling tasks with dplyr - performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with ggplot2\r\n2.0 Setup\r\n2.1 Packages Used\r\n\r\n\r\nThe R packages weâ€™ll be introducing today are: - sf: used for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data - tidyverse: used for importing, wrangling and visualising data (and other data science tasks!)\r\n\r\nNote: Tidyverse consists of a family of R packages, such as readr, tidyr, and dplyr - these are used for the different steps of the data wrangling + visualisation process!\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s a handy code chunk that weâ€™ll likely be putting at the start of every file: it (a) creates a list of packages, (b) checks if they have been installed (and installs it for us if they havenâ€™t), and lastly (c) launches them in the Rstudio environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npackages = c('sf', 'tidyverse')\r\nfor (p in packages){\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p,character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2 Data Used\r\nThe datasets used for this exercise are: - Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from data.gov.sg - Pre-Schools Location from data.gov.sg - Cycling Path from LTADataMall - Singapore Airbnb listing data, 19 July 2021 from Inside Airbnb\r\nA good practice would be to put the data sets in a â€˜dataâ€™ folder, sorted accordingly into â€˜geospatialâ€™ and â€˜aspatialâ€™ folders.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing Geospatial Data into R\r\n3.1 Importing polygon feature data in shapefile format\r\nst_read\r\ntest\r\nglimpse\r\ntest\r\n3.2 Importing polyline feature data in shapefile form\r\nst_read\r\nglimpse\r\n3.3 Importing GIS data in kml format\r\nst_read\r\nglimpse\r\n4.0 Importing + Converting Aspatial Data into R\r\n4.1 Importing aspatial data\r\nread_csv\r\nglimpse\r\n4.2 Converting aspatial data\r\nst_as_sf\r\nglimpse\r\n4.3 Combining it together: Importing asptial data as sf\r\nimport as sf\r\nglimpse\r\n5.0 Geoprocessing\r\n5.1 Buffering\r\n5.2 Point-In-Polygon Count\r\n6.0 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\n6.1 DIY section\r\nDIY: Using ggplot2, plot a scatterplot showing the relationship between Pre-school Density and Pre-school Count.\r\nLetâ€™s approach this step-by-step. Firstly, weâ€™ll need the variables Pre-school Density and Pre-school Count. Luckily, weâ€™ve already created both in 2.5.2 Point-In-Polygon Count, but assuming we havenâ€™t done so, hereâ€™s the code for initialising the variables:\r\nNext, we need to plot a scatterplot. For our histogram, we used geom_histogram - and for a scatterplot, weâ€™ll use geom_point. We can further customise this by adjusting the colour, size and fill of the points, like so:\r\nSeem finished? Thereâ€™s actually one more step: ensuring that your data is presented as fairly as possible - we donâ€™t want to mislead our readers ðŸ˜± In this case, notice that the aspect ratio of our graph is off - its height is greater than its width. Letâ€™s correct that by setting limiters with the xlim() and ylim() functions inside ggplot2:\r\nAnd there we have it!\r\nWeâ€™ve just started on our Geospatial Analytics Journey - walk with me as we dive deeper the coming weeks! ðŸ¤— ðŸ’– âœ¨\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
