## 1.0 Overview
Before we even start, you might be wondering: why geospatial analytics? Why are we learning about it, and how is it relevant to a business or a governmental/academic institution?

A quick Google search brings up thousands upon thousands of answers, articles, and research papers: I recommend [Deloitte's 3-Minute Guide](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Deloitte-Analytics/dttl-analytics-us-ba-geospatial3minguide.pdf) on why geospatial analytics matters and the value it brings to a business its data.

In today's Hands-On Exercise, we'll be doing an introduction to geospatial analytics in R: 

- importing the data and (if necessary) converting it into an accessible format
- carrying out geoprocessing tasks with **sf**
- carrying out data wrangling tasks with **dplyr**
- performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **ggplot2**

## 2.0 Setup

### 2.1 Packages Used

<center>
![](images/packages.png){width=50%}
</center>

The R packages we'll be introducing today are:
- **sf**: used for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data
- **tidyverse**: used for importing, wrangling and visualising data (and other data science tasks!)

>Note: Tidyverse consists of a family of R packages, such as readr, tidyr, and dplyr - these are used for the different steps of the data wrangling + visualisation process!

Here's a **handy code chunk** that we'll likely be putting at the start of every file: it (a) creates a list of packages, (b) checks if they have been installed (and installs it for us if they haven't), and lastly (c) launches them in the Rstudio environment.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, code_folding=FALSE}
packages = c('sf', 'tidyverse')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

### 2.2 Data Used
The datasets used for this exercise are:

- Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/)
- Pre-Schools Location from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/)
- Cycling Path from [LTADataMall](https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall.html)
- Singapore Airbnb listing data, 19 July 2021 from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

A good practice would be to put the data sets in a 'data' folder, sorted accordingly into 'geospatial' and 'aspatial' folders.

## 3.0 Importing Geospatial Data into R
Now that we've got our data, let's take a closer look at the formats they're in and how to import them into R. The geospatial data we have are:

- `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL`, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format, 
- `CyclingPath`, a line feature layer in ESRI shapefile format, and
- `PreSchool`, a point feature layer in kml file format. 

To import, we'll be using a handy function called `st_read()` from the **sf** package. The arguments it takes in depends on the file format. For the shapefile format, two arguments are provided:  `dsn` to define the data path, and `layer` to provide the shapefile name. Bonus: we don't need to specify the file extension for shapefiles `r emo::ji("smile")` On the other hand, for the kml file format, our argument is the complete path with the kml file extension.

### 3.1 Importing polygon feature data in shapefile format
Dataset used: `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL`
File format: shapefile
Data frame type: polygon feature

```{r}
mpsz = st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                  layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

From the output message, we can see that in our `mpsz` simple feature data frame, there are 323 multipolygon features, 15 fields and is in the **svy21** projected coordinates system.

### 3.2 Importing polyline feature data in shapefile form
Dataset used: `CyclingPath`
File format: shapefile
Data frame type: line feature

```{r}
cyclingpath = st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                         layer = "CyclingPath")
```

From the output message, we can see that in our `cyclingpath` linestring feature data frame, there are 1625 linestring features, 2 fields and is in the **svy21** projected coordinates system.

### 3.3 Importing GIS data in kml format
Dataset used: `pre-schools-location-kml`
File format: kml
Data frame type: point feature

```{r}
preschool = st_read("data/geospatial/pre-schools-location-kml.kml")
```

From the output message, we can see that in our `preschool` point feature data frame, there are 1359 linestring features, 2 fields and is in the **wgs84** projected coordinates system.

## 4.0 Importing + Converting Aspatial Data into R
For aspatial data, such as the  `listings` Airbnb datset, there's an extra step in the importing process. We'll import it into a [tibble data frame](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html), then convert it into a simple feature data frame.

### 4.1 Importing aspatial data
Since our `listings` data set is in a csv file format, we'll use the *read_csv()* function from the **readr** package, like so:

```{r}
listings <- read_csv("data/aspatial/listings.csv")
glimpse(listings) 
```

From the output message, we can see that in our `listing` tibble data frame, there are 4252 rows and 16 columns (not features and fields like in our simple data feature frame!) Take note of the `latitude` and `longitude` fields - we'll be using them in the next phase. 

> Assumption: The data is in the **wgs84** Geographic Coordinate System on account of its latitude/longtitude fields.

### 4.2 Converting aspatial data
Now, let's convert our `listing` tibble data frame into a by using the *st_as_sf()* function from the **sf** package.

```{r}
listings_sf <- st_as_sf(listings, 
                       coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                       crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

Let's explain the code chunk!


### 4.3 Combining it together: Importing asptial data as sf {.tabset}

## 5.0 Checking the Content of a Data Frame
Now that we've got our data frames, this begs the question: what exactly *is* inside them? Let's learn how to retrieve the information of the dataframe with 3 simple methods!

### 5.1 st_geometry()
Let's say that we want a preliminary look at our data - just seeing the basic feature information is sufficient. In this case, *st_geometry()* is most appropriate:

```{r}
st_geometry(mpsz)
```

As we can see, only the basic information of the feature class (type of geometry, geographic extent of features and CRS) is displayed.

### 5.2 glimpse()
However, basic information won't take us very far. Let's dig a little deeper and learn about the associated attribute information in the data frame. This is where *glimpse()* comes in:

```{r}
glimpse(mpsz)
```

With *glimpse()*, we now know the data type of each field - for example, `FMEL-UPD_D` field is of the **date** data type.

### 5.3 head()
Sometimes, we want to dig as deep as we can and reveal all the information of a feature object. In this case, *head()* is best:

```{r}
head(mpsz)
```

>Note that the 'n' argument allows us to select how many records to display!

## 6.0 Plotting & Projection

### 6.1 Plotting
Now that we've got our data, we get into the meat of the matter: visualisation! Having a dataframe of fields and data points is taxing for human eyes to process, but with a bit of plotting and mapping, our geospatial data becomes a gold mine of great insights. Let's try to *plot()* it out:

```{r}
plot(mpsz)
```

This is a handy multi-plot of all attributes (up to a reasonable amount). But maybe we just want to plot a specific attribute:

```{r}
plot(mpsz["PLN_AREA_N"])
```

There are also times where we need just the geometry - in other words, the map outline:

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(mpsz))
```

### 6.1 Projection
**Projection transformation** is when we project a simple feature data frame from one coordinate system to another. There are two common issues that require projection transformation: (a) missing or inaccurate coordinate system, or (b) inappropriate coordinate systems for the analysis chosen.

#### 6.1.1 Missing/Inaccurate Coordinate System
To tackle the first issue, we'll need to **assign an ESPG code to the data frame**. Firstly, let's check the coordinate system of our `mpsz` data frame:

```{r}
st_crs(mpsz)
```

Although `mpsz` data frame is projected in svy21, the output indicates that the EPSG is 9001.  This is the wrong EPSG code! The correct EPSG code for svy21 should be [3414](https://epsg.io/3414). Let's change it:

```{r}
mpsz3414 <- st_set_crs(mpsz, 3414)
st_crs(mpsz3414)
```

#### 6.1.2 Inappropriate Coordinate Systems
Still remember our geospatial data overview in 3.0? You might have noticed that the coordinate system differed among our data frames: `mpsz` and `cyclingpath` are **svy21**, while `preschool` is **wgs84**. `preschool` might run into issues when we're performing geoprocessing, because a geographic coordinate system is not appropriate if our analysis needs distance or/and area measurements. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
preschool3414 <- st_transform(preschool, 
                              crs = 3414)
st_geometry(preschool3414)
```

Notice the change to the svy21 projected coordinate system! 

>You might notice that the values in the bounding box have changed, too! They are now greater than the original 0-360 range of decimal degree commonly used by majority of the geographic coordinate systems.

## 7.0 Geoprocessing

### 7.1 Buffering

### 7.2 Point-In-Polygon Count

## 8.0 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### DIY section

**DIY: Using ggplot2, plot a scatterplot showing the relationship between Pre-school Density and Pre-school Count.**

Let's approach this step-by-step. Firstly, we'll need the variables Pre-school Density and Pre-school Count. Luckily, we've already created both in 2.5.2 Point-In-Polygon Count, but assuming we haven't done so, here's the code for initialising the variables:

Next, we need to plot a scatterplot. For our histogram, we used geom_histogram - and for a scatterplot, we'll use geom_point. We can further customise this by adjusting the colour, size and fill of the points, like so:

Seem finished? There's actually one more step: **ensuring that your data is presented as fairly as possible** - we don't want to mislead our readers `r emo::ji("munch")` In this case, notice that the aspect ratio of our graph is off - its height is greater than its width. Let's correct that by setting limiters with the xlim() and ylim() functions inside ggplot2:

And there we have it! 

## 7.0 End Notes
This is the end of this week's exercise! I'm really excited to learn more about geospatial analytics: we've just begun to scratch the surface, and there's so much more to explore and experiment with!

On a related sidenote: I've learned a number of things myself when creating this blog post! For example, I wanted to have a table of contents, but googling 'sidebar navigation pane' proved to be far less effective than just reading the [Distill Basics](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/basics.html) - which is a lesson learnt on reading the provided materials!

On a funny note, here's a mini-comic on my experience with tabsets:

Tabsets are meant for html documents, but this output is a distill article... Of course it didn't work `r emo::ji("loudly_crying_face")` Well, that's just another learning point in our Geospatial Analytics Journey !

Walk with me as we dive deeper the coming weeks! `r emo::ji("hugging_face")` `r emo::ji("sparkling_heart")` `r emo::ji("sparkles")`
